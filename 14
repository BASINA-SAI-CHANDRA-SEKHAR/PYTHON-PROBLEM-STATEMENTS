# Write a function that takes a string and determines if the average length of the words in the string is greater than 4. 
#If the average word length is greater than 4, the function should return 1; otherwise, it should return 0.

# Input Format:
# The input consists of a single string. The string contains words separated by spaces.

# Output Format:
# A single integer: 1 if the average word length is greater than 4, 0 otherwise.

# Example:
# Input:
# The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
# Output:
# 0

string=list(map(str,input().split(" ")))
avg=0
for words in string:
    avg=avg+len(words)
avg /= len(string)
if avg>4:
    print(1,end="")
else:
    print(0,end="")
