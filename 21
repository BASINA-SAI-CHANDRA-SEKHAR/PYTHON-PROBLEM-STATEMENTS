# Write a program that accepts a space-separated string of integers representing a sequence of even length. 
# The program should determine whether the sequence is left-heavy, right-heavy, or balanced. It should print:

# -1 if the sequence is left-heavy (left half sum > right half sum).
# 1 if the sequence is right-heavy (right half sum > left half sum).
# 0 if the sequence is balanced (both sums are equal).
# Input Format:
# The input consists of a single line containing space-separated integers.
# Output Format:
# A single integer: -1 for left-heavy, 1 for right-heavy, or 0 for balanced.
# Example:
# Input:
# 1 2 3 4 5 6
# Output:
# 1


s=input().split(' ')
right=0
left=0
l=[int(num) for num in s]
for i in range(len(l)//2):
    left+=l[i]
for i in range(len(l)//2,len(l)):
    right+=l[i]
if left>right:
    print(-1)
elif left<right:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
