# Calculate the difference between the sum of elements at odd indices and the XOR of elements at even indices in an integer array.
# Input:
# An integer ( N ) representing the length of the array.
# An integer array ( A ).
# Output: The difference between the sum of elements at odd indices and the XOR of elements at even indices.
# Example:

# Input: ( N = 6 ), ( A = [10,5,6,3,7,2] )
# Output: (-1)
