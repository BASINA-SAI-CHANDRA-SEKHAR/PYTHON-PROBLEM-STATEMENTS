"Problem statement It is Edwardâ€™s birthday today. His friends have bought him a huge circular cake.
Edward wants to find out the maximum number of pieces he can get by making exactly N straight vertical cuts on the cake.
Your task is to write a function that returns the maximum number of pieces that can be obtained by making N number of cuts. Note: Since the answer can be quite large, modulo it by 1000000007.

Input Specification:

input1: An integer N denoting the number of cuts
Output Specification:

Return the maximum number of pieces that can be obtained by making N cuts on the cake."


n=int(input())
if n>0:
    c=(n*(n+1)//2)+1
    d=c%1000000007
print(d)
