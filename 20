You are given two input strings: input1 and input3, along with an integer input2 that represents the size of input1. 
Write a program that performs the following tasks: Write a function countOccurrences that counts how many times the string input3 appears in the string input1.

e.g. Input1: ‘abcc’ 
Input2:4  
Input3: ‘c’
output:2

def countOccurrences(input1,input3):
    count=0
    for char in input1:
        if char in input3:
            count+=1
    return count
input1=input()
input3=input()
input2=len(input1)
print("len of input1",input2)
print(countOccurrences(input1,input3))
