#You are given an array of length n and index k, where 0<k<n. You need to print the absolute difference between the sum of elements to the left of index k and sum of elements to the right of index k.

arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
k=5
n=len(arr)
if k<n+1:
    c=arr[0:k-1]
    d=arr[k:]
    e=sum(c)
    f=sum(d)
    print(abs(e-f))
else:
    print("not valid")
