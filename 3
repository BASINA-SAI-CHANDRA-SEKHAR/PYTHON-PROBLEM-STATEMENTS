# You are required to input the size of the matrix then the elements of matrix, then you have to divide the main
# matrix in two sub matrices (even and odd) in such a way that element at 0 index will be considered as even and
# element at 1st index will be considered as odd and so on. then you have sort the even and odd matrices in
# ascending order then print the sum of second largest number from both the matrices

# Example

# enter the size of array : 5

# enter element at 0 index : 3

# enter element at 1 index : 4

# enter element at 2 index : 1

# enter element at 3 index : 7

# enter element at 4 index : 9

# Sorted even array : 1 3 9
# Sorted odd array : 4 7

# 7

arr=[3,4,1,7,9]

arr1=[]
arr2=[]
for i in range(0,n,2):
    arr1.append(arr[i])
for i in range(1,n,2):
    arr2.append(arr[i])
sorted(arr1)
sorted(arr2)
if arr1[1]>arr2[1]:
    print(arr1[1])
else:
    print(arr2[1])
