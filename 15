# Write a function that takes an integer n representing the number of nodes in a complete graph and returns the total number of edges in the graph.
# A complete graph is a graph in which every pair of distinct nodes is connected by a unique edge.


# Input Format:
# The input consists of a single integer n which represents the number of nodes in the complete graph.

# Output Format:
# A single integer representing the total number of edges in the complete graph of n nodes.

# Example:
# Input:
# 4

# Output:
# 6

nodes=int(input())
c=nodes*(nodes-1)//2
print(c,end="")
