# Write a program that accepts the string `para` and a positive integer `n` as input. 
#The program should print `1` if there is at least one word in `para` that occurs exactly `n` times, and `0` otherwise.

# Input Format:
# The input consists of two lines.
#   - The first line contains the string `para`, which is a sequence of space-separated words.
#   - The second line contains a positive integer `n`.

# Output Format:
# - A single integer, either `1` or `0`.
#   - Print `1` if there is at least one word that occurs exactly `n` times.
#   - Print `0` otherwise.

# Example:
# Input:
# apple orange apple banana orange banana banana
# 2

# Output:
# 1

n=int(input())

    if i in count:

    else:
        count[i]=1
for i in count:
    if count[i]>=n:
        print(1)
        break
else:
    print(0)
