Problem statement:
An odd number is an integer which is not a multiple of 2.
You are required to implement the following function: int SumOddIntegers(int arr[], int n); The function accepts an integer array ‘arr’ of length ‘n’ as its argument. 
You are required to calculate the sum of all odd integers in an array ‘arr’ and return the same.

Note:
Array can have negative integers
n > 0
Computed values lie within integer range"



def SumOddIntegers(arr,n):
    n=len(arr)
    count=0
    if n>0:
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i]%2!=0:
                count+=arr[i]
    return count
arr=[-1,2,3,-4,5]
print(SumOddIntegers(arr,n))
